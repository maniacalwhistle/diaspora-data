[_The context below was taken directly from the cite, even if it is not blockquote. We may either paraphrase or decide to quote directly. Put this here just a placeholder._]

In August 2000 the California legislature found that:

> "Insurance policies from the slavery era have been discovered in the archives of several insurance companies, documenting insurance coverage for slaveholders for damage to or death of their slaves, issued by a predecessor insurance firm. These documents provide the first evidence of ill-gotten profits from slavery, which profits in part capitalized insurers whose successors remain in existence today." SB2199 Sec. 1(a).

To date, the compliance response rate is approximately 92%. The basic reasons for incomplete reporting are that the insurer failed to describe the research it did to determine whether or not it has documents related to slavery era insurance, or failed to report as to predecessor companies.

Some policies cover multiple lives.
