## Context:
[_insert background for dataset -- What is this data? Where'd it come from? how was it used? Why is it important?_]

[_@letishasmith The context below was taken directly from the cite, even if it is not blockquote. We may either paraphrase or decide to quote directly. Put this here just a placeholder._]

In August 2000 the California legislature found that:

> "Insurance policies from the slavery era have been discovered in the archives of several insurance companies, documenting insurance coverage for slaveholders for damage to or death of their slaves, issued by a predecessor insurance firm. These documents provide the first evidence of ill-gotten profits from slavery, which profits in part capitalized insurers whose successors remain in existence today." SB2199 Sec. 1(a).

To date, the compliance response rate is approximately 92%. The basic reasons for incomplete reporting are that the insurer failed to describe the research it did to determine whether or not it has documents related to slavery era insurance, or failed to report as to predecessor companies. Some policies cover multiple lives.


## Content:

[_insert more information about the structure of the data. Include any notes about transformations or pre-processing that took place_]

The dataset contains the following information for each of the 675 slaves where policy information was available:


* Name of Slave: name of slave; can include first and last name
* Slave County (or Parish), State: slave's residence or place of work (_speculative_)
* Other Identifying Information: includes occupation/role and policy number
* Slaveholder: name of slaveholder; can include first and last name
* Slaveholder County (or Parish), State: slaveholder's residence or place of doing business (_speculative_)
* Submitted by: Name of insurance company who submitted policy; however, name could be different than the name of the company at the time it issued policy


## Acknowledgements:

This dataset was compiled by The California Department of Insurance (DOI). Policy records were submitted to California DOI after the California State Legislature passed SB 2199, authored by former Senator Tom Hayden (D-Los Angeles). The statute is entitled "Slavery Era Insurance Policies". Slavery Era insurance policies were obtained from insurers licensed and doing business in this state regarding any records of slaveholder insurance policies issued by any predecessor corporation during the slavery era.
