# TO-DO:

__Need to...__\
figure out if we actually need to merge slave-names and slaveholder-names datasets.
In the slaves-names data, the name of that slave's slaveholder is listed (in the `slaveholder` column).
And the reverse is true for the slaveholder-names dataset.

__Need to...__\
decide if we want to submit the data "as-is" or do some cleaning. For example, should we split `Name of Slave` column into separate `First Name` and `Last Name` columns? Same question for the `County (or Parish), State` and `Slaveholder Name `columns.

__Need to...__\
complete data documentation in the `overview.md` file.
